# Badkitty
Remake of the BadKitty druid addon through TellMeWhen scripts

## How to use
Current version has each spec as a seperate file. Will work on merging all into 1 addon script for ease of use.

1) Download the latest version of TellMeWhen (Latest update when written is v8.2.3)
2) Open the TellMeWhen config by typing /tmw show
3) Right click on any icon (blank or otherwise) you see
4) Copy the entire text from whatever spec you want to add and paste it into the textbox at the bottom of the TMW config screen
5) Click import/export/restore -> from string -> Profile: <profile name> -> Copy Profile - Create New Profile
6) Close that window and click "Exit config mode" in the other TMW window

The scripts are currently set to only show during combat so you'll need to find a dummy/mob to test them on. To update, follow steps 2-6 but click Copy Profile - Overwrite <profile name> during step 5

## Contributing

All contributions are appreciated, especially for other specs. Simply keep the same basic structure as the current script to make merging easier.

## Known bugs

- Omen of Clarity procs not showing
- Text on cooldown bars is somewhat thick
- No icon in top right of feral spec (any suggestions?)
